    "The STP and FTP labels are often used interchangeably to reference shielded and/or foiled cables. STP and FTP braided and foiled shields can also exist together in the same cable for extra protection against interference. It is important to check the manufacturer’s description of the Ethernet cable to determine which interference-reducing method was used in the manufacturing of the cable. UTP, STP, and FTP Ethernet cables can also be manufactured to have braided and/or foil shields around each of the four twisted pairs. This configuration further reduces crosstalk amongst the twisted pairs, but is the most expensive of the Ethernet cable options. A shielded with foiled twisted pair (SF/FTP) would most likely be used in an industrial environment where EMI and/or RFI is much higher than normal."

A crossover cable should be connected between the Ethernet port/Network Interface Card (NIC) on the IT administrative system and the management port of the Enterprise machine. This connection is then used to access the operating system and/or the management interface of the Enterprise machine. Additionally, crossover cables can connect two switches, two hubs, or a switch to a hub, as well as two routers, two PCs, or a router to a PC.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Like straight-through cables, crossover cables can also be identified by comparing both ends of the cable to one another. Crossover cable ends will have different patterns in the color order of the twisted pairs.  The crossover cable key below describes a typical setup for a T-568-A. If the green wires appear in pin positions 1 and 2 on one side of the cable, on the opposite end of the cable, the green wires will appear in the pin positions 3 and 6. The orange wires will appear in positions 3 and 6 at one end of the cable, crossing over to the 1 and 2 positions at the opposite end. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the T-568-B scheme, if you see orange wires start at pin positions 3 and 6, they should cross over to pin positions 1 and 2 at the opposite end of the cable. Green wires should start at pin positions 1 and 2, crossing over to 3 and 6 at the opposite end. This wiring crossover is needed to connect two computers that transmit and receive data on the same wires. Blue and brown wires do not cross over to different positions in this set-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Straight-through cables use the T568B wiring scheme, while crossover cables use both schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Crossover cable key:\n",
    "- Endpoint 1 of the Ethernet cable:\n",

    "IP addresses are distributed in large sections to various organizations and companies instead of being determined by hardware vendors. This means that IP addresses are more hierarchical and easier to store data about than physical addresses are. Think of IBM, which owns every single IP that has the Number 9 as the first octet. At a very high level, this means that if an Internet router needs to figure out where to send a data packet intended for the IP address `9.0.0.1`, that router only has to know to get it to one of IBM's routers. That router can handle the rest of the delivery process from there. \n",

    "IP addresses belong to the _networks_, not to the devices attached to those networks. Your laptop will always have the same MAC address no matter where you use it, but it'll have a different IP address assigned to it at an Internet cafe than it would when you're at home. The LAN at the Internet cafe or the LAN at your house would each be individually responsible for handing out an IP address to your laptop if you power it on there. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a day-to-day basis, getting an IP address is usually a pretty invisible process. On many modern networks, you can connect a new device and an IP address will be assigned to it automatically through a technology known as **[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)](#dhcp)**. An IP address assigned this way is known as a **dynamic** IP address. The opposite of this is known as a **static** IP address, which must be configured on a node manually. In most cases, static IP addresses are reserved for servers and network devices while dynamic IP addresses are reserved for clients. But there are certainly situations where this might not be true."

If the total amount of data that needs to be sent is larger than what can fit in a single data gram the IP layer needs to split this data up into many individual packets.

Every time a datagram reaches a new router, that router deck remains the TTL field by one. Once this value reaches zero, a router knows it doesn't have to forward the datagram any further. The main purpose of this field is to make sure that when there's a miss configuration in routing that causes an endless loop datagrams don't spend all eternity trying to reach their destination. And endless loop could be when router `A` thinks router `B` is the next hop and router `B` thinks router `A` is the next hop. \n",

You might have picked up on the fact that our IP datagram also has a payload section. The contents of this payload are the entirety of a TCP or UDP packet. Hopefully this helps you better understand why we talk about networking in terms of layers, each layer is needed for the one above it."

But as the Internet continued to grow, traditional subnetting just couldn't keep up. \n",

This means that there might only be 254 classing networks in existence. But it also means there are 2,097,152 potential class C networks. That's a lot of entries in a routing table. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many companies ended up with various adjoining class C networks to meet their needs. That meant that routing tables ended up with a bunch of entries for a bunch of class C networks that were all actually being routed to the same place. This is where **classless inter-domain routing (CIDR)** comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "CIDR is even more flexible approach to describing blocks of IP addresses. It expands on the concept of subnetting by using subnet masks to demarcate networks. To demarcate something means to set something off. When discussing computer networking, you will often hear the term **demarcation point** to describe where one network or system ends and another one begins. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous model, we relied on a network ID, subnet ID, and host ID to deliver an IP datagram to the correct location. With CIDR, the network ID and subnet ID are combined into one. CIDR is where we get this shorthand slash notation that we discussed in the earlier video on subnetting. This slash notation is also known as **CIDR notation**. CIDR basically just abandons the concept of address classes entirely, allowing an address to be defined by only two individual IDs. \n",

    "Let's take `9.100.100.100` with a net mask of `255.255.255.0`. Remember, this can also be written as `9.100.100.100/24`. In a world where we no longer care about the address class of this IP, all we need is what the network mask tells us to determine the network ID. In this case, that would be `9.100.100`. The host ID remains the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "This practice not only simplifies how routers and other network devices need to think about parts of an IP address, but it also allows for more arbitrary network sizes. Before, network sizes were static, think only class A, class B, or class C, and only subnets could be of different sizes. CIDR allows for networks themselves to be differing sizes. Before this, if a company needed more addresses than a single class C could provide, they need an entire second class C. With CIDR they could combine that address space into one contiguous chunk with a net mask of slash 23 or `255.255.254.0`.\n",

Router A believes that the quickest path to network X is through its own interface to which is where router C is connected.

This is more easily accomplished by splitting the number in four sections of eight bits, especially back in the day when address classes ruled the world.

    "\n",

This means that the transmitting device wants the receiving device to push currently-buffered data to the application on the receiving end as soon as possible. A **buffer** is a computing technique where a certain amount of data is held somewhere before being sent somewhere else. This has lots of practical applications. In terms of TCP, it's used to send large chunks of data more efficiently. By keeping some amount of data in a buffer, TCP can deliver more meaningful chunks of data to the program waiting for it. But in some cases you might be sending a very small amount of information that you need the listening program to respond to immediately. This is what the push flag does.\n",

    "The fourth flag is `RST`, short for reset. This means that one of the sides in a TCP connection hasn't been able to properly recover from a series of missing or malformed segments. It's a way for one of the partners in a TCP connection to basically say, \"_wait, I can't put together what you mean, let's start over from scratch_\". \n",

This is computer A's way of saying, let's establish a connection and look at my sequence number field so we know where this conversation starts. Computer B then responds with a TCP segment where both the `SYN` and `ACK` flags are sent.

    "A connection at the transport layer implies that every segment of data sent is acknowledged, this way both ends of the connection always know which bits of data have definitely been delivered to the other side and which haven't. \n",
    "\n",
    "Connection-oriented protocols are important because the internet is a vast and busy place and lots of things could go wrong while trying to get data from point a to point b. If even a single bit doesn't get transmitted properly, the resulting data is often incomprehensible by the receiving end. And remember that at the lowest level, a bit is just an electrical signal within a certain voltage range. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there are plenty of other reasons why traffic might not reach its destination beyond lineaires. It could be anything, pure congestion might cause a router to drop your traffic in favor of forwarding more important traffic. Or a construction company could cut a fiber cable connecting to ISPs, anything's possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Connection-oriented protocols like TCP, protect against this by forming connections and through the constant stream of acknowledgments. Our protocols at lower levels of our network model like IP and Ethernet, do use check sums to ensure that all the data they received was correct. But did you notice that we never discussed any attempts at resending data that doesn't pass this check? That's because that's entirely up to the transport layer protocol. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the IP or Ethernet level, if a checksum doesn't compute all of that data is just discarded, it's up to TCP to determine when to resend this data. Since TCP expects an `ACK` for every bit of data it sends, it's in the best position to know what data successfully got delivered and can make the decision to resend a segment if needed. This is another reason why sequence numbers are so important. While TCP will generally send all segments in sequential order, they may not always arrive in that order. If some of the segments had to be resent due to errors at lower layers, it doesn't matter if they arrive slightly out of order. This is because sequence numbers allow for all of the data to be put back together in the right order. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you might have picked up on, there's a lot of overhead with connection-oriented protocols like TCP. You have to establish the connection, you have to send a stream of constant streams of acknowledgments. You have to tear the connection down at the end, that all accounts for a lot of extra traffic. Well this is important traffic, it's really only useful if you absolutely, positively have to be sure your data reaches its destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can contrast this with **connectionless protocols**, the most common of these is known as **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**. Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't rely on connections and it doesn't even support the concept of an acknowledgement. With UDP, you just set a destination port and send the packet. This is useful for messages that aren't super important, a great example of UDP is streaming video. Let's imagine that each UDP Datagram is a single frame of a video, for the best viewing experience, you might hope that every single frame makes it to the viewer, but it doesn't really matter if a few get lost along the way. A video will still be pretty watchable unless it's missing a lot of its frames. By getting rid of all the overhead of TCP, you might actually be able to send higher quality video with UDP. That's because you'll be saving more of the available bandwidth for actual data transfer instead of the overhead of establishing connections and acknowledging delivered data segments."

    "The networking stack will now examine its own subnet. It sees that it lives on the network `10.1.1.0/24`, which means that the destination `172.16.1.100` is on another network. At this point, Computer 1 knows that it will have to send any data to its gateway for routing to a remote network and it's been configured with a gateway of `10.1.1.1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Computer 1 looks at its ARP table to determine what MAC address of `10.1.1.1` is, but it doesn't find any corresponding entry. Oh, it's okay. Computer A crafts in ARP request for an IP address of `10.1.1.1`, which it sends to the hardware broadcast address of all S. This ARP discovery request is sent to every node on the local network. When router A receives this ARP message, it sees that it's the computer currently assigned the IP address of `10.1.1.1`. It responds to Computer 1 to let it know about its own MAC address of `00: 11:22:33:44:55`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer 1 receives this response and now knows the hardware address of its gateway. This means that it's ready to start constructing the outbound packet. Computer 1 knows that it's being asked by the web browser to form an outbound TCP connection, which means it will need an outbound TCP port. The operating system identifies the ephemeral port of `50,000` as being available and opens a socket connecting the web browser to this port. Since this is a TCP connection, the networking stack knows that before it can actually transmit any of the data the web browser wants it to, it'll need to establish a connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The networking stack starts to build a TCP segment. It fills in all the appropriate fields in the header, including a source port of `50,000` and a destination port of `80`. A sequence number is chosen and is used to fill in the sequence number field. Finally, the `SYN` flag is set and a checksum for the segment is calculated and written to the checksum field. Our newly constructed TCP segment is now passed along to the IP layer of the networking stack. This layer constructs an IP header. This header is filled in with the source IP, the destination IP, and a TTL of `64`, which is a pretty standard value for this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the TCP segment is inserted as the data payload for the IP datagram and a checksum is calculated for the whole thing. Now that the IP datagram has been constructed, Computer 1 needs to get this to its gateway, which it now knows has a MAC address of `00:11:22:33:44:55`. An Ethernet frame is constructed. All the relevant fields are filled in with the appropriate data, most notably the source and destination MAC addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the IP datagram is inserted as the data payload of the Ethernet frame and another checksum is calculated. Now we have an entire Ethernet frame ready to be sent across the physical layer. The network interface connected to Computer 1 sends this binary data as modulations of the voltage of an electrical current running across a CAT6 cable that's connected between it and a network switch. This switch receives the frame and inspects the destination MAC address. The switch knows which of its interfaces this MAC address is attached to and forwards the frame across only the cable connected to this interface. At the other end of this link is Router A, which receives the frame and recognizes its own hardware address as the destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "Router A knows that this frame is intended for itself, so it now takes the entirety of the frame and calculates a checksum against it. Router A compares this checksum with the one in the Ethernet frame header and sees that they match, meaning all of the data has made it in one piece. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Router A strips away the Ethernet frame, leaving it with just the IP datagram. Again, it performs a checksum calculation against the entire datagram and again, it finds that it matches, meaning all the data is correct. It inspects the destination IP address and performs a lookup of this destination in its routing table. Router A sees that in order to get data to the `172.16.1.0/24` network. The quickest path is one hop away via Router B, which has an IP of `192.168.1.1`. Router A looks at all the data in the IP datagram, decrements the TTL by one, calculates a new checksum reflecting the new TTL value and makes a new IP datagram with this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Router A knows that it needs to get this datagram to Router B, which has an IP address of `192.168.1.1`. It looks at its ARP table and sees that it has an entry for `192.168.1.1`. Now Router A can begin to construct an Ethernet frame with the MAC address of its interface on Network B as the source and the MAC address of Router B's interface on Network B as the destination. Once the values for all fields in this frame have been filled out, Router A places the newly constructed IP datagram into the data payload field, calculates a checksum and places this checksum into place and sends the frame out to Network B. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like before, this frame makes it across Network B and is received by Router B. Router B performs all the same checks, removes the Ethernet frame encapsulation and performs a checksum against the IP datagram. It then examines the destination IP address. Looking at its routing table, Router B sees that the destination address of Computer 2, or `172.16.1.100` is on a locally connected network, so it decrements the TTL by one again, calculates a new checksum and creates a new IP datagram. This new IP datagram is again encapsulated by a new Ethernet frame. This one with the source and destination MAC address of Router B and Computer 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "The whole process is repeated one last time. The frame is sent out onto Network C, a switch ensures it gets sent out of the interface that Computer 2 is connected to. Computer 2 receives the frame, identifies its own MAC address as the destination and knows that it's intended for itself. Computer 2 then strips away the Ethernet frame, leaving it with the IP datagram. It performs a CRC and recognizes that the data has been delivered intact. It then examines the destination IP address and recognizes that as its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Computer 2 strips away the IP datagram, leaving it with just the TCP segment. Again, the checksum for this layer is examined and everything checks out. Next, Computer 2 examines the destination port, which is `80`. The networking stack on Computer 2 checks to ensure that there's an open socket on Port `80`, which there is. It's in the listening state and held open by running Apache web server. Computer 2 then sees that this packet has the `SYN` flag set. It examines the sequence number and stores that since it'll need to put this sequence number in the acknowledgment field once it crafts the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all of that, all we've done is get a single TCP segment containing a `SYN` flag from one computer to a second one. Everything would have to happen all over again for Computer 2 to send a `SYN/ACK` response to Computer 1. Then everything would have to happen all over again for Computer 1 to send an `ACK` back to Computer 2, and so on and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at all of this end-to-end hopefully helps show how all the different layers of our networking model have to work together to get the job done. I hope it also gives you some perspective in understanding how remarkable computer networking truly is."

    "At the very lowest levels, all computers really understand are one and zero. Reading binary numbers isn't the easiest for humans, so most binary numbers are represented in lots of different forms. This is especially true in the realm of networking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine having to remember the four octets of an IP address for every website you visit. It's just not a thing that the human brain is normally good at. Humans are much better at remembering words. That's where **Domain Name System (DNS)** comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "**DNS** is a global and highly distributed network service that resolves strings of letters into IP addresses for you. Let's say you wanted to check a weather website to see what the temperature is going to be like. It's much easier to type `www.weather.com` into a web browser than it is to remember that one of the IP addresses for this site is `184.29.131.121`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IP address for a domain name can also change all the time for a lot of different reasons. A **domain name** is just the term we use for something that can be resolved by DNS. In the example we just used, `www.weather.com` would be the domain name and the IP it resolves to could change depending on a variety of factors. Let's say that \"weather.com\" was moving their web server to a new data center, maybe they've signed a new contract or the old data center was shutting down. By using DNS, an organization can just change what IP domain name resolves to and the end user would never even know. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does DNS make it easier for humans to remember how to get to a website, it also lets administrative changes happen behind the scenes without an end-user having to change their behavior. Try to imagine a world where you'd have to remember every IP for every website you visit while also having to memorize new ones if something changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of DNS for how the Internet operates today can't be overstated. IP addresses might resolve to different things depending on where in the world you are. While most Internet communications travel at the speed of light, the further you have to route data, the slower things will become. In almost all situations, it's going to be quicker to transmit a certain amount of data between places that are geographically close to each other. If you're a global web company, you'd want people from all over the world to have a great experience accessing your website. Instead of keeping all of your web servers in one place, you could distribute them across data centers across the globe. This way, someone in New York visiting a website might get served by a web server close to New York, while someone in New Delhi might get served by a web server close to New Delhi. Again, DNS helps provide this functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its global structure, DNS let's organizations decide if you're in the region, resolve the domain name to this IP. If you're in this other region, resolve this domain to this other IP. DNS serves lots of purposes and might be one of the most important technologies to understand as an IT support specialist so you can effectively troubleshoot networking issues."

    "At its most basic, DNS is a system that converts domain names into IP addresses. It's the way humans are likely to remember and categorize things resolved into the way computers prefer to think of things. This process of using DNS to turn a domain name into an IP address is known as **name resolution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at exactly how this works. The first thing that's important to know is that DNS servers are one of the things that need to be specifically configured at a node on a network. For a computer to operate on a modern network, they need to have certain number of things configured. Remember that MAC addresses are hard-coded and tied to specific pieces of hardware, but we've also covered that the \n",
    "- IP address, \n",
    "- subnet mask and \n",
    "- gateway for a host \n",
    "\n",
    "must be specifically configured. A \n",
    "\n",
    "- DNS server \n",
    "\n",
    "is the fourth and final part of the standard modern network configuration. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are almost always the four things that must be configured for a host to operate on a network in an unexpected way. I should call out that a computer can operate just fine without DNS or without a DNS server being configured, but this makes things difficult for any human that might be using that computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are five primary types of DNS servers:\n",
    "- caching name servers, \n",
    "- recursive name servers, \n",
    "- root name servers, \n",
    "- TLD name servers and \n",
    "- authoritative name servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we dive deeper into these, it's important to note that any given DNS server can fulfill many of these roles at once. **Caching and recursive name servers** are generally provided by an ISP or your local network. Their purpose is \n",
    "\n",
    "> to store domain name lookups for a certain amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you'll see in a moment, there are lots of steps in order to perform a fully qualified resolution of a domain name. In order to prevent this from happening every single time a new TCP connection is established, your ISP or local network will generally have a caching name server available. Most caching name servers are also recursive name servers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive name servers** are ones that perform full DNS resolution requests. In most cases, your local name server will perform the duties of both, but it's definitely possible for a name server to be either just caching or just recursive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce an example to better explain how this works. You and your friend are both connected to the same network and you both want to check out \"facebook.com\". Your friend enters `www.facebook.com` into a web browser, which means that their computer now needs to know the IP of `www.facebook.com` in order to establish a connection. Both of your computers are on the same network, which usually means that they've both been configured with the same name server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your friend's computer asks the name server for the IP of `www.facebook.com`, which it doesn't know. This name server now performs a fully recursive resolution to discover the correct IP for `www.facebook.com`. This IP is then both delivered to your friend's computer and stored locally in a cache. A few minutes later, you enter `www.facebook.com` into a web browser. Again, your computer needs to know the IP for this domain, so your computer asks the local name server it's been configured with, which is the same one your friend's computer was just talking to. Since the domain name `www.facebook.com` had just been looked up, the local name server still has the IP that it results to stored and is able to deliver that back to your computer without having to perform a full lookup. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the same servers act as a caching server. All domain names in the global DNS system have a **time to live (TTL)**. This is a value, in seconds that can be configured by the owner of a domain name for how long a name server is allowed to cache an entry before it should discard it and perform a full resolution again. Several years ago, it was normal for these TTLs to be really long, sometimes a full day or more. This is because the general bandwidth available on the Internet was just much less, so network administrators didn't want to waste what bandwidth was available to them by constantly performing full DNS lookups. As the Internet has grown and gotten faster, these TTLs for most domains have dropped to anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, but it's important to know that sometimes you still run into a domain names with very lengthy TTLs. It means that it can take up to the length of a total TTL for a change in DNS record to be known to the entire Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at what happens when your local recursive server needs to perform a full recursive resolution. The first step is always to contact a **root name server**. There are 13 total root name servers and they're responsible for directing queries toward the appropriate **TLD name server**. In the past, these 13 root servers were distributed to very specific geographic regions, but today they're mostly distributed across the globe via Anycast. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Anycast** is a technique that's used to route traffic to different destinations depending on factors like location, congestion or link health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using Anycast, a computer can send a datagram to a specific IP, but could see it routed to one of many different actual destinations depending on a few factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This should also make it clear that there aren't really only 13 physical root name servers anymore. It's better to think of them as 13 authorities that provide root name lookups as a service. The root servers will respond to a DNS lookup with the TLD name server that should be queried. \n",
    "\n",
    "> TLD stands for **top-level domain** and represents the top of the hierarchical DNS name resolution system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A TLD is the last part of any domain name using `www.facebook.com` as an example again, the `.com` portion should be thought of as the TLD. For each TLD in existence, there is a TLD name server. But just like with root servers, this doesn't mean there's only physically one server in question. It's most likely a global distribution of Anycast accessible servers responsible for each TLD. \n",
    "\n",
    "The TLD name servers will respond again with a redirect, this time informing the computer performing the name lookup with what authoritative name server to contact. **Authoritative name servers** are responsible for the last two parts of any domain name, which is the resolution at which a single organization may be responsible for DNS lookups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using `www.weather.com` as an example, the TLD name server will point a lookup at the authoritative server for \"weather.com\", which would likely be controlled by the \"weather\" channel, the organization itself that runs the site. Finally, the DNS lookup could be redirected at the authoritative server for \"weather.com\", which would finally provide the actual IP of the server in question. "

It's so that full lookup path doesn't have to happen for every single TCP connection. In fact, your local computer from your phone to a desktop will generally have its own temporary DNS cache as well. That way, it doesn't have to bother its local name server for every TCP connection either."

    "DNS is a great example of an application layer service that uses UDP for the transport layer instead of TCP, this can be broken down into a few simple reasons. Remember that the biggest difference between TCP and UDP is that UDP is connectionless this means there's no set up or tear down of a connection. So much less traffic needs to be transmitted overall. \n",
    "\n",
    "A single DNS request and its response can usually fit inside of a single UDP datagram, making it an ideal candidate for a connectionless protocol, it's also worth calling out that DNS can generate a lot of traffic. It's true that caches of DNS entries are stored both on local machines and cashing name servers, but it's also true that if the full resolution needs to be processed, we're talking about a lot more traffic. Let's see what it would look like for a full DNS look up to take place via TCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the host that's making the DNS resolution request would send a `SYN` packet to the local name server on port `53` which is the port that DNS listens on. This name server would then need to respond with a `SYN- ACK` packet. That means the original host would have to respond with an `ACK` in order to complete the three way handshake, that's three packets. Now that the connection has been established, the original host would have to send the actual request: \"_I'd like the IP address for food.com please_\". When it receives this request, the name server would have to respond with another `ACK`: \"_I got your request for food.com_\", we're up to five packets sent now. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our scenario, the first cashing name server doesn't have anything cached for \"food.com\". So it needs to talk to a root name server, to find out who's responsible for the \".com\" TLD. This would require a three way handshake: the actual request, the `ACK` or the request, the response and then the `ACK` of the response. Finally, the connection would have to be closed via a four way handshake. That's 11 more packets or 16 total. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the recursive name server has the correct TLD name server, it needs to repeat that entire process to discover the proper authority of name server. That's 11 more packets bringing us up to 27 so far. Finally, the recursive name server would have to repeat the entire process one more time while talking to the authoritative name server in order to actually get the IP of \"food.com\". This is 11 more packets for a running total of 38. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the local name server finally has the IP address of \"food.com\", it can finally respond to the initial request. It responds to the DNS resolver that originally made the request and then this computer sends an `ACK` back to confirm that it received the response. That's two more packets, putting us at 40. Finally, the TCP connection needs to be closed via a four way handshake. This brings us to a grand total of 44 packets at the minimum in order for a fully recursive DNS request to be fulfilled via TCP. \n",
    "\n",
    "44 packets isn't really a huge number in terms of how fast modern networks operate, but it heads up fast as you can see, remember that DNS traffic is just a precursor to actual traffic. A computer almost always performs a DNS look up because it needs to know the IP of a domain name in order to send it additional data, not just because it's curious. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's check out how this would look with UDP, spoiler alert, it doesn't take as many packets. The original computer sends a UDP packet to its local name server on port `53` asking for the IP for \"food.com\", that's one packet. The local name server acts as a recursive server and sends up a UDP packet to the root server which sends a response containing the proper TLD name server, that's three packets. The recursive name server sends a packet to the TLD server and receives back a response containing the correct authority server, we're now at five packets. Next, the recursive name server sends its final request to the authority of name server which sends a response containing the IP for food.com, that's seven packets. Finally, the local name server responds to the DNS resolver that made the request in the first place with the IP for \"food.com\". That brings us to a grand total of eight packets. "

The DNS resolver just asks again if it doesn't get a response, basically the same functionality that TCP provides at the transport layer is provided by DNS at the application layer, in the most simple manner. A DNS server never needs to care about doing anything but responding to incoming lookups and a DNS resolver simply needs to perform lookups and repeat them if they don't succeed. A real showcase of the simplicity of both DNS and UDP.\n",
    "\n",

As the web has gotten more complex, it's no longer the case that all DNS lookup responses can fit in a single UDP datagram. In these situations, a DNS name server would respond with a packet explaining that the response is too large. The DNS client would then establish a TCP connection in order to perform the lookup."

    "DNS in practice, operates with a set of defined resource record types. These allow for different kinds of DNS resolutions to take place. There are dozens of different resource record types to find, but a lot of them only serve very specialized purposes. We'll cover the most basic ones here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common resource record is known as an A record. \n",
    "\n",
    "> An **A record** is used to point a certain domain name at a certain IPv4 IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our earlier discussions of DNS, we made the assumption that the DNS resolver was asking for the A record for a domain name. In its most basic use, a single A record is configured for a single domain name, but a single domain name can have multiple A records too. This allows for a technique known as DNS round robin to be used to balance traffic across multiple IPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Round robin** is a concept that involves iterating over a list of items one by one in an orderly fashion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The hope is that this ensures a fairly equal balance of each entry on the list that's selected. Let's say we're in charge of a domain name `www.microsoft.com`. Microsoft is a large company, and their website likely sees a lot of traffic. To help balance this traffic across multiple servers, we configure four A records for `www.microsoft.com` at the authoritative name server for the `microsoft.com `domain. We'll use the IPs `10.1.1.1`, `10.1.1.2`, `10.1.1.3`, and `10.1.1.4`. When a DNS resolver performs a look up of `www.microsoft.com,` all four IPs would be returned in the order, first configured: `10.1.1.1` followed by `10.1.1.2`, followed by `10.1.1.3`, and finally `10.1.1.4`. The DNS resolving computer would know that it should try to use the first entry, `10.1.1.1`. But it knows about all four just in case a connection to `10.1.1.1` fails. The next computer to perform a look up for `www.microsoft.com,` would also receive all four IPs in the response, but the ordering will have changed. The first entry would be `10.1.1.2`, followed by `10.1.1.3`, followed by `10.1.1.4`, and finally `10.1.1.1` would be last on that list. This pattern would continue for every DNS resolution attempt, cycling through all of the A records configured, and balancing the traffic across these IPs. That's the basics of how DNS round robin logic works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another resource record type that's becoming more and more popular is the quad A record. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **quad A record** is very similar to an A record, except that it returns an IPv6 address instead of an IPv4 address. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNAME record is also super common. \n",
    "\n",
    "> A **CNAME record** is used to redirect traffic from one domain to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that Microsoft runs their web servers at `www.microsoft.com`. They also want to make sure that anyone that enters just `microsoft.com` into their web browser, will get properly redirected. By configuring a `CNAME` record for `microsoft.com` that resolves to `www.microsoft.com`, the resolving client would then know to perform another resolution attempt, this time, for `www.microsoft.com`, and then use the IP returned by that second attempt. `CNAME`s are really useful because they ensure you only have to change the canonical IP address of a server in one place. In fact, `CNAME` it's just shorthand for canonical name. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we look again at our original example of making sure that visitors to both `microsoft.com `and `www.microsoft.com`, get to the same place, we could do this in two ways. We could set up identical A records for both `microsoft.com` and `www.microsoft.com` domain names. And this would work just fine. But if the underlying IP address ever changes, we need to change it in two places, the A records for both `microsoft.com` and `www.microsoft.com`. By setting up a `CNAME` that points `microsoft.com` at `www.microsoft.com`, you'd only have to change the A record for `www.microsoft.com.` And you know the clients pointing at either domain would get the new IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might not seem like a huge deal with just two records to worry about, but large companies with complex presences on the web might have dozens of these kinds of redirections. It's always easier to only have one source of truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important resource record type is the MX record. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mail exchange (MX) record** is used in order to deliver email to the correct server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies run their web and mail servers on different machines with different IPs. So the MX record makes it easy to ensure that email gets delivered to a company's mail server, while other traffic like web traffic, would get delivered to their web server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Record type very similar to the MX record, is the SRV record. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Service record (**SRV**) is used to define the location of various specific services. \n",
    "\n",
    "It serves the exact same purpose as the MX resource record type except for one thing: while MX is only for mail services, an SRV record can be defined to return the specifics of many different service types. For example, SRV records are often used to return the records of services like Cal Dave, which is a calendar and scheduling service. \n",
    "\n",
    "The text record type is an interesting one. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **TXT** (text) was originally intended to be used only for associating some descriptive text with a domain name for human consumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was that you could leave notes or messages that humans could discover and read to learn more about arbitrary specifics of your network. But over the years as the internet and services that run on it have become more and more complex, the text record has been increasingly used to convey additional data intended for other computers to process. Since the text record has a field that's entirely free form, clever engineers have figured it out ways to use it to communicate data not originally intended to be communicated by a system like DNS. This text record is often used to communicate configuration preferences about network services that you've entrusted other organizations to handle for your domain. For example, it's common for the text record to be used to convey additional info to an email as a service provider, which is a company that handles your email delivery for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of other DNS resource record types in common use, like the NS or SOA records which are used to define authoritative information about DNS zones."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "With DHCP, a machine can query a DHCP server when the computer connects to the network and receive all the networking configuration in one go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only does DHCP reduce the administrative overhead of having to configure lots of network devices on a single network, it also helps address the problem of having to choose what IP to assign to what machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer on a network requires an IP for communications, but very few of them require an IP that would be commonly known. For servers or network equipment on your network, like your gateway router, a static and known IP address is pretty important. For example, the devices on a network need to know the IP of their gateway at all times. If the local DNS server was malfunctioning, network administrators would still need a way to connect to some of these devices through their IP. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without aesthetic IP configured for a DNS server, it would be hard to connect to it, to diagnose any problems if it was malfunctioning. But for a bunch of client devices, like desktops or laptops, or even mobile phones, it's really only important that they have an IP on the right network. It's much less important exactly which IP that is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using DHCP, you can configure a range of IP addresses that's set aside for these client devices. This ensures that any of these devices can obtain an IP address when they need one but solves the problem of having to maintain a list of every node on the network and its corresponding IP. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few standard ways that DHCP can operate. DHCP, **dynamic allocation** is the most common, and it works how we described it just now: \n",
    "\n",
    "> a range of IP addresses is set aside for client devices and one of these IPs is issued to these devices when they request one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under a dynamic allocation, the IP of a computer could be different almost every time it connects to the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic allocation** is very similar to dynamic allocation in that a range of IP addresses is set aside for assignment purposes. The main difference here is that \n",
    "\n",
    "> the DHCP server is asked to keep track of which IPs it's assigned to certain devices in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information, the DHCP server will assign the same IP to the same machine each time if possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's what's known as fixed allocation. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fixed allocation** requires a manually specified list of MAC address and their corresponding IPs. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a computer requests an IP, the DHCP server looks for its MAC address in a table and assigns the IP that corresponds to that MAC address. If the MAC address isn't found, the DHCP server might fall back to automatic or dynamic allocation, or it might refuse to assign an IP altogether. This can be used as a security measure to ensure that only devices that have had their MAC address specifically configured at the DHCP server will ever be able to obtain an IP and communicate on the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth calling out that DHCP discovery can be used to configure lots of things beyond what we've touched on here. Along with things like IP address and primary gateway, you can also use DHCP to assign things like NTP servers. NTP stands for **Network Time Protocol** and is used to keep all computers on a network synchronized in time."

DHCP listens on UDP port `67` and DHCP discovery messages are always sent from UDP port `68`. The DHCP discover message encapsulated in a UDP datagram with a destination port of `67` and a source port of `68`. This is then encapsulated inside of an IP datagram with a destination IP of `255.255.255.255` and a source IP of `0.0.0.0`.

    "Unlike protocols like DNS and DHCP, **Network Address Translation (NAT)**, is a technique instead of a defined standard. This means that some of what we'll discuss in this lesson might be more high level than some of our other topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different operating systems and different network hardware vendors have implemented the details of NAT in different ways, but the concepts of what it accomplishes are pretty constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Network Address Translation does pretty much what it sounds like. It takes one IP address and translates it into another. There are lots of reasons why you would want to do this. They range from security safeguards to preserving the limited amount of available IPV4 space. We'll discuss the implications of NAT and the IPV4 address space later in this lesson, but for now, let's just focus on how NAT itself works and how it can provide additional security measures to a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its most basic level, \n",
    "\n",
    "> NAT is a technology that allows a gateway, usually a router or a firewall to rewrite the source IP of an outgoing IP datagram while retaining the original IP in order to rewrite it into the response. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain this better, let's look at a simple NAT example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have two networks. Network A consists of the `10.1.1.0/24` address space, and Network B consists of the `192.168.1.0/24` address space. Sitting between these networks is a router that has an interface on Network A with an IP of `10.1.1.1 `and an interface on Network B of `192.168.1.1`. Now, let's put two computers on these networks. Computer 1 is on Network A and has an IP of `10.1.1.100` and Computer 2 is on Network B and has an IP of `192.168.1.100`. Computer 1 wants to communicate with a web server on Computer 2. It crafts the appropriate packet at all layers and sends this to its primary gateway, the router sitting between the two networks. So far, this is a lot like many of our earlier examples, but in this instance, the router is configured to perform NAT for any outbound packets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a router will inspect the contents of an IP datagram, decrement the TTL by one, recalculate the checksum and forward the rest of the data at the network layer without touching it, but with NAT, the router will also rewrite the source IP address, which in this instance becomes the router's IP on Network B or `192.168.1.1`. When the datagram gets to Computer 2, it will look like it originated from the router, not from Computer 1. Now, Computer 2 crafts its response and sends it back to the router. The router, knowing that this traffic is actually intended for Computer 1, rewrites the destination IP field before forwarding it along. What NAT is doing in this example is hiding the IP of Computer 1 from Computer 2. This is known as **IP masquerading**. "

By using NAT in the way we've just described we could actually have hundreds of computers on Network A, all of their IPs being translated by the router to its own. To the outside world, the entire address space of Network A is protected and invisible. This is known as **one-to-many NAT**, and you'll see it in use on lots of LANs today."

    "NAT at the network layer is pretty easy to follow. One IP address is translated to another by a device, usually a router. But at the transport layer, things get a little bit more complicated and several additional techniques come into play to make sure everything works properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "With one-to-many NAT, we've talked about how hundreds, even thousands of computers can all have their outbound traffic translated via NAT to a single IP. This is pretty easy to understand when the traffic is outbound, but a little more complicated once return traffic is involved. We now have potentially hundreds of responses all directed at the same IP and the router at this IP needs to figure out which responses go to which computer. \n",

    "\n",
    "> **Port preservation** is a technique where the source port chosen by a client is the same port used by the router. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that outbound connections choose a source port at random from the ephemeral ports or the ports in the range 49,152 through 65,535. In the simplest setup, a router setup to NAT outbound traffic will just keep track of what the source port is and use that to direct traffic back to the right computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a device with an IP of `10.1.1.100`. It wants to establish an outbound connection and the networking stack of the operating system chooses port `51,300` for this connection. Once this outbound connection gets to the router, it performs network address translation and places its own IP in the source address field of the IP datagram, but it leaves the source port in the TCP datagram the same, and stores this data internally in a table. Now, when traffic returns to the router on port `51,300`, it knows that this traffic needs to be forwarded back to the IP `10.1.1.100`. Even with how large the set of ephemeral ports is, it's still possible for two different computers on a network to both choose the same source port around the same time. When this happens, the router normally selects an unused port at random to use instead. "

A reverse proxy in this situation could act as a single front end for many web servers living behind it. From the client's perspective, it looks like they're all connected to the same server. But behind the scenes, this reverse proxy server is actually distributing these incoming requests to lots of different physical servers. Much like the concept of DNS round robin, this is a form of **load balancing**. "

If you had an office with more than a few employees, the bandwidth available by a single dialogue connection would quickly be over saturated by just a few users. By the mid 1990s, it had become pretty common for businesses that needed internet access for their employees to use various T-carrier technologies. \n",

In the days of dial-up, even a single image on a web page could take many seconds to download and display. High resolution photos that you can now take on a cellphone, would have required a long time to download, and a lot of your patience. A single picture taken on a smartphone today can easily be several megabytes in size. Two megabytes would translate to 16,777,216 bits at a baud rate of 14.4 kilobits per second.

Years later, the same technology was repurposed for data transfers.

For example, when you open a web page in a web browser, the upload or outbound data is pretty small. You're just asking for a certain webpage from the web server. The download or inbound data tends to be much larger since it will contain the entire webpage, including all images and other media. For this reason, asymmetric lines often provide a similar user experience for a typical home user, but at a lower cost. \n",

Most SDSL technologies have an upper cap of 1.544 megabits a second or the same as a T1 line. \n",

    "Further developments in SDSL technology have yielded things like **High bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines (HDSL)**. These are DSL technologies that provision speeds above 1.544 megabits per second. There are lots of other minor variations in DSL technology out in the wild offering different bandwidth options and operating distances. These variations can be so numerous and minor. It's not really practical to try to cover them here. If you ever need to know more about a specific DSL line, you should contact the ISP that provides it for more details."

    "\n",
    "- **Packet switching**: A method of data transmission. In packet switching, messages are broken into multiple packets. Each packet contains a header that includes information on how to reassemble the packets, as well as the intended destination of the packets. As a measure to prevent data corruption, the packets are triplicated. The triplicated packets are sent separately over optimal routes through the internet. Then, once the packets reach their destination, they are reassembled. The triplicate copies are compared with one another to detect and correct any data corruption that occurred during transmission (at least two of the three copies should match). If the data cannot be reassembled and/or data corruption is evident in all three copies, the destination will make a request to the origin to resend the packet.\n",

However, the technology is now used in other network interfaces. Frame relays are used to transmit data between endpoints of a WAN through a packet switching method that works at the OSI data link and physical layers. A fast data communications network, called a **Frame Relay Network**, is used to transport data packets in frames. The reliability of Frame Relay Networks minimizes the need for error checking.

ATM can send the cells over a long distance, which makes it useful for WAN communications. ATMs uses routers as end-points between ATM networks and other networks. ATM technology has been replaced for the most part by Internet Protocol (IP) technologies. \n",

    "- **Higher data rates**: Band splitting or increased client group sizes allow for uploading and downloading greater amounts of data.\n",
    "- **Increased band capacity**: Band utilization increased from 80mHz to 160mHz, creating a faster connection from the router to connected devices.\n",
    "- **Better performance**: The input/output streams are doubled from the 4 by 4 allowed by Wi-Fi 5, to 8 by 8 in Wi-Fi 6, allowing more clients to be grouped. \n",
    "- **Improved power efficiency**: Devices only connect to the network when sending or receiving data, increasing battery life. \n",

    "Wi-Fi 6 technology improves functionality and connectivity.\n",
    "- **Channel sharing** for better efficiency and shortens the time it takes to send data once a user gives the send command. \n",
    "- **Target Wake Time (TWT)** improves the network speed and increases battery life by allowing battery-powered devices to sleep when not in use. \n",
    "- **Multi-user MIMO (Multiple Input, Multiple Output)** wireless technology allows more data to be transferred simultaneously. This ability increases capacity and efficiency in high bandwidth applications like voice calls or video streaming.\n",
    "- **160 MHz channel utilization** gives more space for transmitting data and increases bandwidth capability.\n",
    "- **1024 Quadrature amplitude modulation** combines two signals into a single channel, so more data is encoded.\n",
    "- **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)** allows for bandwidth splitting, which is assigned dynamically by the access point to separate devices. \n",

These wireless technologies include Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, ZigBee, Thread, Bluetooth, and Near Field Communication (NFC). Radio and microwave frequency bands each have specific ranges that are divided into channels. Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz microwave radio frequency band ranges for sending and receiving data. Some Wi-Fi routers use multiple channels within each range to avoid signal interference and to load-balance network traffic. Wi-Fi is commonly used for wireless local area networks (WLANs). \n",

    "**IEEE 802.11 standards**\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1997, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) ratified the first 802.11 standard for wireless fidelity (later branded as Wi-Fi). The standard was first published for use by computer device manufacturers to use as a common protocol for wireless communications. The IEEE has amended the 802.11 specifications multiple times over the years with updates and additional enhancements to 802.11 Wi-Fi. The IEEE names each new amendment with one or two letters appended to 802.11 (e.g., 802.11n or  802.11ax). The IEEE plans to continue updating the 802.11 specifications until a new technology replaces Wi-Fi. \n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of wireless networks use the IEEE 802.11 standards for Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi networks include client devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, smartphones, IoT devices, etc.) that are configured to connect to wireless access points. This configuration is referred to as “infrastructure mode”. Access points can serve both wireless and wired network traffic. For wired traffic, the access point works as a bridge between wireless devices and a wired network. The access point connects to an Ethernet switch through a wired Ethernet cable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The various amended 802.11 specifications use the same fundamental data link protocol. However, some characteristics may vary at the OSI physical layer, including:\n",
    "- signal ranges\n",
    "- modulation techniques\n",
    "- transmission bit rates\n",
    "- frequency bands\n",
    "- channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that countries around the world may impose different regulations on channel usage, power limitations, and Wi-Fi ranges. A technology called **dynamic frequency selection (DFS)** is also required to prevent 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals from interfering with local radar and satellite communications. \n",
    "\n",
    "A comparison of the frequencies, maximum data rates, and maximum signal ranges for each 802.11 update over the years is detailed below:"

As an IT Support specialist, you may need to support data collection from IoT devices. For example, you may work for a company that uses an array of IoT sensors in a manufacturing setting to help with the remote monitoring and proactive maintenance of industrial machines. You may need to manage the software applications and data transfer protocols that support automated and human interaction with the IoT devices and the data they collect. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data protocol models used with IoT**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common data protocol models to illustrate how low-power IoT devices share data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Request/Response model**: Often used in distributed systems where the communication flow between servers and clients consists of requests and responses for data. Examples include HTTP and CoAP (described in the “IoT data protocols at the application layer” section below)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Publish/Subscribe model**: A framework for message exchanges between publishers (hosts) and subscribers (clients) that are routed through a broker. Subscribers can sign up to a channel to receive notices through the broker when the publisher releases new messages. Examples: MQTT and AMQP (described in the “IoT data protocols at the application layer” section below).\n",
    "\n",
    "**IoT data protocols at the application layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "IoT devices can collect environmental data around their physical location (e.g., temperature),  equipment data (e.g., maintenance status), and metered data (e.g., electricity usage). Data protocols are needed to transfer and format the data for use by applications that interface with either humans or automated systems. IoT devices can be configured to use various data transfer and formatting protocols at the OSI application/software layer of communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most IoT devices can use at least one of the following data transfer protocols:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure (HTTP/HTTPS)**: HTTP and HTTPS are the most widely used information transfer protocols across the World Wide Web (WWW). The protocols define how information is formatted and transmitted. HTTP/HTTPS uses ASCII formatting, has a header size of 8 bytes, and is designed for transmitting documents. HTTP/HTTPS use either Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for sending information across the internet. HTTP/HTTPS uses the request/response model. When a website address is entered into a browser, HTTP/HTTPS sends a request to the site’s web server, which then returns an HTTP/HTTPS formatted response to the browser. The protocols use ports 80 or 8080 and data security is provided on the HTTPS version of the protocol. HTTP is supported by Google Cloud IoT Core for device-to-cloud communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communication Protocols**: A set of direct communication methods for low-power devices, machines, and systems. There are three primary architectural and protocol groups in M2M electronic communications:\n",
    "    - **Representational State Transfer (REST)**: An architectural style for communication amongst web accessible systems. \n",
    "    - **Service-oriented Architectures (SOA)**: An architecture for data exchanges in industrial automation systems. \n",
    "    - **Message Oriented Protocols**: A protocol for asynchronous data transfers for distributed systems.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)**: An IoT data-centric interaction protocol for M2M that uses a simple publish-subscribe model. MQTT supports Quality of Service (QoS), uses TCP for sending information, and utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) for security. MQTT using binary format and 2-byte header sizes for efficient messaging. MQTT is supported by Google Cloud IoT Core for device to cloud communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)**: A web transfer protocol for IoT constrained nodes and networks designed for M2M applications. CoAP is used for IoT applications like building automation and smart energy management. CoAP is very similar to HTTP: both are based on the REST model and both place resources on a server that is accessible to clients via a URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)**: An open standard for messaging amongst applications in different organizations and/or platforms. Its purpose is to remove vendor lock-in for app communication. In addition to interoperability, AMQP also offers reliability and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)**: A decentralized, open standard for chat, messaging, video and voice calls, collaboration tools, and more. Built upon Jabber, XMPP offers a proven communication technology that is extensible, flexible, and diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Distribution Service (DDS)**: An API standard and middleware protocol from the Object Management Group. Middleware exists in the OSI applications layer, between software and the operating system. DDS uses the publish-subscribe communications model. DDS is also data-centric, provides low-latency data connectivity, and helps the devices in an IoT ecosystem share data more efficiently. DDS is reliable, scalable, and provides control of QoS parameters, including bandwidth and resource limits. "

Every device involved with the network communicates with every other device within range, and all nodes help pass along messages. Even though they're the most simple, ad-hoc networks aren't the most common type of wireless network, but they do have some practical applications. Some smartphones can establish ad-hoc networks with other smartphones in the area so that people can exchange photos, video, or contact information. You'll also sometimes see ad-hoc networks used in industrial or warehouse settings where individual pieces of equipment might need to communicate with each other, but not with anything else. Finally, ad-hoc networks can be powerful tools during disaster situations. If a natural disaster like an earthquake or hurricane knocks out all of the existing infrastructure in an area, disaster relief professionals can use an ad-hoc network to communicate with each other while they perform search and rescue efforts.

    "The most common type of wireless network you'll run into in the business world is a **wireless LAN (WLAN)**. A wireless LAN consists of one or more access points which act as bridges between the wireless and wired networks. The wired network operates as a normal LAN, like the types we've already discussed. The wired LAN contains the outbound Internet link. In order to access resources outside of the WLAN, wireless devices would communicate with access points. They then forward traffic along to the gateway router where everything proceeds like normal. "

Most mesh networks you'll run into are made up of only wireless access points, and will still be connected to a wired network. This network lets you deploy more access points to the mesh without having to run a cable to each of them. With this setup, you can really increase the performance and range of a wireless network."

You will also learn about various internet connectivity technologies, as well as the basics of wireless and cellular networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "WPA3 is built upon the WPA2 protocol and is intended to replace WPA2. The WPA3 protocol introduces new features and methods to repair the security weaknesses of WPA2. The benefits of this advancement in Wi-Fi security include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplified wireless security\n",
    "- Stronger authentication \n",
    "- Powerful encryption \n",
    "- Stable business continuity\n",
    "- Enhanced security methods\n",
    "- Replacement for legacy protocols\n",
    "- Protected Management Frames (PMF) requirement for enterprise networks\n",
    "- WPA3 offers two versions, a personal and an enterprise version.\n",

    "**WPA3-Personal**\n",
    "\n",
    "WPA3-Personal is intended for individual users and personal/home Wi-Fi networks. This protocol addresses common cybersecurity weaknesses that affect consumers’ wireless devices. It also simplifies Wi-Fi security for users. The improvements to WPA3-Personal include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Natural password selection**: Gives users the ability to set passwords that are easier for the user to remember. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased ease of use**: Users do not need to change the way they connect to Wi-Fi to benefit from WPA3’s improved security. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Forward secrecy**: If a password is stolen, WPA3 can continue to protect data that is transmitted. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**: WPA3-Personal improves upon the WPA2-Personal **Pre-Shared Key (PSK)** handshake protocol. SAE uses PSK to generate a **Pairwise Master Key (PMK)**. The PMK uses password-based authentication and is shared between a Wi-Fi access point and a wireless device. The pair use a complex, multi-stage process for proving to one another that they each possess the PMK. This complex handshake makes it extremely difficult for cybercriminals to intercept packets in order to extract an identifiable authentication key. If the SAE transaction is successful, the wireless device will pass the authentication stage and gain access to the secured Wi-Fi network. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SAE authentication also reduces the probability of successful dictionary and brute force attacks, in which cybercriminals try to crack short, weak, and commonly used passwords. Additionally, SAE corrects a weakness exploited by cybercriminals who could perform **key reinstallation attacks (KRACKs)** when in close proximity to a Wi-Fi user. This type of attack could decrypt data and expose passwords, credit card information, photos, chats, emails, and more.  \n",
    "\n",
    "WPA3-Enterprise\n",
    "WPA3-Enterprise is intended for business networks with multiple users. This protocol addresses the WPA2-Enterprise weaknesses that cybercriminals have been able to exploit. In addition to the WPA3-Personal SAE improvements, the WPA3-Enterprise security improvements and options include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP-256)**: The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** with GCMP-256-bit encryption replaces the WPA2 128-bit AES-Counter Mode Protocol **(CCMP)** Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code **(CBC-MAC)**. GCMP provides data integrity and confidentiality. The GCMP-256-bit encryption strength takes significantly more computing power for cybercriminals to crack than 128-bit encryption. The average person would not have access to that level of computing power. GCMP-256-bit encryption provides a stronger security protocol and makes it harder for cybercriminals to perform Meddler-in-the-Middle attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)**: OWE improves upon the WPA2 wireless encryption standard of 802.1x Open Authentication and Extensible Authentication Protocol (**EAP**). In WPA2, EAP required additional support to help it encrypt and authenticate login credentials. In the WPA3 protocol, OWE replaces EAP with a solution that encrypts and authenticates all wireless traffic. It also replaces Wi-Fi passwords by assigning a unique key to each device that has permission to access the network. This technology repairs a weakness Wi-Fi users experience in open networks, which are often found in restaurants, coffee shops, hotels, airports, malls, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wi-Fi Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP)**: DPP improves upon the WPA2 Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) encryption technology between wireless devices and routers. WPA3’s DPP uses QR codes or NFC tags to grant passwordless Wi-Fi access to wireless devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **384-bit Hashed Message Authentication Mode (HMAC) with Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)**: HMAC creates hash code from a secret key. This hash code is sent with each message passed between a Wi-Fi access point and a user’s device. The hash code from the origin of the message is compared to the hash code from the receiver of the message to determine if the hash codes match. A discrepancy between the two hashes would indicate that the message was compromised or corrupted during transmission.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Exchange (ECDHE) and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**: In WPA3, key management and authentication use the ECDHE protocol and ECDSA encryption for faster performance. The protocol is supported by most browsers. This key management technology replaces the WPA2 4-way handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaways**\n",
    "\n",
    "As the tech industry develops more powerful computers, cybercriminals will use them to crack older encryption standards. The need to create more complex encryption algorithms will always be present in order to stay ahead of the evolving tools used by cybercriminals.\n",

The 2.4 GHz frequency extends to 150 feet (45 meters) indoors and 300 feet (92 meters) outdoors. However, the 2.4 GHz frequency can experience congestion due to a limited number of channels. Plus, 2.4 GHz is more likely to experience interference from other nearby devices that use the same frequency, like microwaves. The 5 GHz frequency provides a stronger signal than 2.4 GHz and has more channels to handle more traffic. The 5 GHz drawback is that its range is limited to 50 feet (12 meters) indoors and 100 feet (30.6 meters) outdoors. \n",

    "- **IEEE 802.15.4**: An inexpensive, low-power wireless access technology intended for IoT devices that operate on battery power. IEEE 802.15.4 uses the 2.4 GHz or lower radio band frequencies. IEEE 802.15.4 is normally used for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs) and uses a 128-bit encryption. Examples of IoT technologies that use IEEE 802.15.4 network connections include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **ZigBee**: An LR-WPAN intended for smart home use. However, ZigBee has also been adopted globally for commercial IoT products. ZigBee includes a universal language that facilitates the interoperability of smart objects through a self-healing mesh network. ZigBee LR-WPAN networks can be accessed through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Thread**: A low-latency wireless mesh networking protocol based on IPv6 addressing and existing open standards and technologies. These characteristics make thread networks compatible with a broad spectrum of IoT ecosystems. Thread devices do not use proprietary gateways or translators, making them inexpensive and easier to implement and maintain than other wireless technologies. Thread is used by the Google Nest Hub Max.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Wave**: An interoperable, wireless mesh protocol (described below) that is based on low powered radio frequency (RF) communications. The Z-Wave protocol uses an RF signal on the 908.2MHz frequency band and extends 330 feet. Z-Wave allows users to control and monitor IoT smart devices. Z-Wave is inexpensive, reliable, and simple to use. The Z-wave protocol supports a closed network for security purposes. Over 3300 types and models of home and business IoT devices are certified to use Z-Wave technology, with more than 100 million devices in use worldwide.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wireless mesh network (WMN)**: Mesh networks are used by many popular wireless IoT network protocols, like Zigbee and Z-Wave, for device communication. Wireless mesh networks use less power than other wireless connectivity options. Wireless mesh is a decentralized network of connected wireless access points (WAP), also called nodes. Each WAP node forwards data to the next node in the network until the data reaches its destination. This network design is “self-healing,” meaning the network can recover on its own when a node fails. The other nodes will reroute data to exclude the failed node. Wireless mesh is a good option for high reliability and low power consumption, which is better for battery powered IoT devices. Wireless mesh networks can be configured to be full or partial mesh:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Full mesh network**: Every node can communicate with all of the other nodes in the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Partial mesh network:** Nodes can only communicate with nearby nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bluetooth**: Bluetooth is a widely used wireless network that operates at a 2.45 GHz frequency band and facilitates up to 3 Mbps connections among computing and IoT devices. Bluetooth has a range of up to 100 feet (30.6 meters) and can accommodate multiple paired connections. It is a good choice for creating a short distance wireless connection between Bluetooth enabled devices. Bluetooth is often used by computing devices to manage, configure, control, and/or collect small amounts of data from one or more close range IoT devices. For example, Bluetooth may be used to control smart home lighting or thermostat IoT devices from a smartphone. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Near-Field Communication (NFC)**: NFC is a short-range, low data, wireless communication protocol that operates on the 13.56 MHz radio frequency. NFC technology requires a physical chip (or tag) to be embedded in the IoT device. NFC chips can be found in credit and debit cards, ID badges, passports, wallet apps on smartphones (like Google Pay), and more. A contactless NFC scanner, like a Point-of-Sale (PoS) device, is used to read the chip. This scanner communication connection often requires the IoT device to be within 2 inches (6 cm) of the scanner, but some NFC chips have an 8 inch (20 cm) range. This short-distance range helps to limit wireless network security threats. However, criminals can carry a portable NFC scanner into a crowded area to pick up NFC chip data from items like credit cards stored inside purses and wallets. To protect against this type of data theft, the cards should be placed inside special NFC/RFID sleeves that make the chips unreadable until they are removed from the sleeves. NFC technology may also be used in the pairing process for Bluetooth connections. \n",
