    "\n",
    "[Article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/technet-magazine/hh148159(v=msdn.10)) 08/31/2016 Raymond Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "_When you get the stats for the size of a folder, where, exactly, do those measurements come from?_\n",
    "\n",
    "When you right-click to view the properties of a folder, the property sheet includes two values: Size and Size on disk. What exactly do these values mean? What are they measuring?\n",
    "\n",
    "The property sheet performs a naïve recursive directory search for all files. It doesn’t try to filter out file names referring to the same underlying file by means of a hard link. If you don’t have access to a subdirectory, the recursive directory search will skip that subdirectory, and those files won’t be counted in the total folder size.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the recursive directory search has some smarts. Part of it is being smart on purpose: It detects reparse points and doesn’t recurse into them. Another part is being smart by accident: Symbolic links to files count as zero size. This isn’t because the directory search code is clever about the files. It’s because the directory entry for symbolic links reports them as having zero size. Now you know what files are counted, but where do those numbers come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Size Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Size measurement is easy: It’s a running tally of the file sizes as reported by the FindFirstFile function in the WIN32_FIND_DATA.nFileSizeLow and nFileSizeHigh. Mind you, those values aren’t necessarily accurate either because of the way the NTFS file system updates directory entries. That’s a topic for another day, but the short version is that files still being written to may not report an accurate file size until the file handle is closed. Even then, it will only update the directory entry used to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Size on disk measurement is more complicated. If the drive supports compression (as reported by the FILE_FILE_COMPRESSION flag returned by the GetVolumeInformation function) and the file is compressed or sparse (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE), then the Size on disk for a file is the value reported by the GetCompressedFileSize function. This reports the compressed size of the file (if compressed) or the size of the file minus the parts that were de-committed and logically treated as zero (if sparse). If the file is neither compressed nor sparse, then the Size on disk is the file size reported by the FindFirstFile function rounded up to the nearest cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Windows 95 team originally developed the Size on disk algorithm. Their view of the file system world was biased by their MS-DOS background. There the only disk file system was FAT. There was no such thing as a hard link or alternate data stream. File contents were stored in units of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those assumptions don't hold true for NTFS—not even the “file contents are stored in units of clusters” part. In NTFS, a file can actually consume zero clusters for its data by stashing itself into slack space in the master file table (MFT). (For more details on this, see “[The Four Stages of NTFS File Growth](https://blogs.technet.com/b/askcore/archive/2009/10/16/the-four-stages-of-ntfs-file-growth.aspx)”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, the Size on disk algorithm doesn’t take into account other file system overhead, like the disk space occupied by the file name itself, directory entry information, file metadata and alternate data streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values reported by Size and Size on disk aren’t meant to be a byte-for-byte accounting of the total impact of a directory on your disk free space. They’re just a rough estimate based on the assumption that most files are of the boring variety. By that, I mean no hard links and negligible use of alternate data streams. If you have a directory with numerous hard links—such as the Windows directory itself, for example—the values will be way off.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Size on disk as a sniff-test to get a rough idea of the size of a directory, but remember that it’s a naïve calculation. If you need to keep careful tabs on disk consumption, you’d be better off using a feature like Disk Quotas, whose purpose is to more intelligently track disk consumption."

    "Although many alternatives for user authentication are available today, most users log on to their computer and remote computers using a combination of their user name and a password typed at their keyboard. There are products that use more secure technologies such as biometrics, smart cards, and one-time passwords available for all popular operating systems; but the reality is that many organizations still rely on passwords and they will continue to do so for years to come. Users often have many different computer accounts at work, for their cell phone, at their bank, with insurance companies, and so on. To make it easier to remember their passwords, users often use the same or similar passwords on each system; and given a choice, most users will select a very simple and easy-to-remember password such as their birthday, their mother's maiden name, or the name of a relative. Short and simple passwords are relatively easy for attackers to determine. Some common methods that attackers use for discovering a victim's password include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guessing-The attacker attempts to log on using the user's account by repeatedly guessing likely words and phrases such as their children's names, their city of birth, and local sports teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Online Dictionary Attack-The attacker uses an automated program that includes a text file of words. The program repeatedly attempts to log on to the target system using a different word from the text file on each try.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offline Dictionary Attack-Similar to the online dictionary attack, the attacker gets a copy of the file where the hashed or encrypted copy of user accounts and passwords are stored and uses an automated program to determine what the password is for each account. This type of attack can be completed very quickly once the attacker has managed to get a copy of the password file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offline Brute Force Attack-This is a variation of the dictionary attacks, but it is designed to determine passwords that may not be included in the text file used in those attacks. Although a brute force attack can be attempted online, due to network bandwidth and latency they are usually undertaken offline using a copy of the target system's password file. In a brute force attack the attacker uses an automated program that generates hashes or encrypted values for all possible passwords and compares them to the values in the password file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these attack methods can be slowed down significantly or even defeated through the use of strong passwords. Therefore, whenever possible, computer users should use strong passwords for all of their computer accounts. Computers running versions of Windows based on Microsoft Windows NT, including Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, support strong passwords. In Windows, a strong password is a password that includes characters from at least three of the five groups in the following Character Classes table.\n",

This document describes how passwords are stored in the Windows family of operating systems and gives guidance to Administrators on how to maximize the security of their passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contradictory requirements can be overcome by thinking about pass phrases rather than passwords. Every version of Windows that supports strong passwords supports the use of spaces and punctuation symbols in account passwords. For example, \"I re@lly want to buy 11 Dogs!\" is a valid pass phrase. With more than twenty characters it is a very long pass phrase, and it includes characters from 4 of the 5 possible groups. It is also easy to remember! Most password cracking tools assume the password will never exceed 14 characters, which is the limit that DOS network boot disks, Microsoft Remote Installation Services (RIS) Pre eXecutable Environment (PXE) boot disks, and older LAN Manager clients (Win9x) must utilize. Even without complexity, a very long password (>14 characters, up to 128 characters) can be the best possible protection against having an especially sensitive password broken.\n",

    "Note: Do not use the example passwords within this document. Although the password discussed above, \"I re@lly want to buy 11 Dogs!\", is very long and complex, attackers may add it and other sample passwords in this document to their attack tools.\n",

Most brute force password cracking tools start out by search for alphanumeric characters and symbols present on most keyboards such as ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ - + = (sometimes called the \"upper row symbols\" because they appear on the top row of most U.S. keyboards).

    "To organization members:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak and blank passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into your computer and our organization's network. Passwords that are used for years at a time, or passwords that are reused frequently, are also much more likely to be discovered by an attacker.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the protection of your account on the network, you are required to use strong passwords when accessing corporate computer systems. You will be required to change your password periodically, and you will be required to use passwords that do not match your previous passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong password is a password that is at least eight characters long and uses characters from three of the five following groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lowercase letters\n",
    "- Uppercase letters\n",
    "- Numbers (for instance, 1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- Symbols (for instance, @, =, -, and so on)\n",
    "- Unicode characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Your passwords will also not be able to contain three or more consecutive letters from your user account name. You will be required to change your password every 42 days, and you will not be able to reuse passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you change your password, your new password will automatically be checked for complexity and it will be compared to your previous passwords. This may sound like a frustrating situation and you may be tempted to write down your password and paste it to your desk, computer monitor, or some other easily accessed location. However, the moment you do that you are exposing your computer and our entire organization to tremendous risk as anyone could walk up to your computer and log on to the network using your credentials. Therefore, never write down your passwords. Instead, create passwords that are easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find some more background information about password security as well as specific advice on how to create strong passwords that are easy to remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using Pass Phrases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps it might be easier to think in terms \"pass phrases\" rather than \"passwords.\" If your computer is running Windows NT 4.0 or earlier, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, passwords up to fifteen or more characters are supported, including spaces. Therefore, \"You can try to break this until the cows come home!\" is a perfectly valid pass phrase that will be extremely difficult for an attacker to break even using the best password cracking tool around. If your computer is running one of the operating systems mentioned above, try to use a very long pass phrase that includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you should not actually use the example passwords within this document, although the password discussed above, \"You can try to break this until the cows come home \" is very long attackers may add it and other sample passwords in this document to their attack tools. These are examples, you should always create your own unique passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "**More Password Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "The following information provides tips and do's and don'ts for creating and remembering passwords and password phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use more than one word**\n",
    "Instead of only using the name of someone you know, such as \"Allison\", choose something about that person no one else knows about, for instance, \"AllisonsBear\" or \"AlliesBear\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use symbols instead of characters**\n",
    "Many people tend to put the required symbols and numbers at the end of a word they know, for instance, \"Allison1234\". Unfortunately, this is relatively easy to break. The word \"Allison\" is in a lot of dictionaries that include common names; once the name is discovered, the attacker has only four more relatively easy characters to guess. Instead, replace one or more of the letters within the word with symbols that you'll easily recall. Many people have their own creative interpretations of what letter some symbols and numbers resemble. For example, try substituting \"@\" for \"A\", \"!\" for \"l\", a zero (0) for an \"O\", a `$` for an \"S\", and a \"3\" for an \"E\". With substitutions such as these, \"@llis0nbe@r\", \"A!!isonB3ar\", and \"A//i$onBear\" are all recognizable to you, but they would be extremely difficult to guess or break. Look at the symbols on your keyboard and think of the first character that comes to mind-it might not be what someone else would think of, but you will remember it. Use some of those symbols as substitutions for your passwords from now on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choose events or people that are on your mind**\n",
    "To remember a strong password that will have to change in several months, try selecting an upcoming personal or public event. Use this as an opportunity to remind yourself about something pleasant that is going on in your life, or a person whom you admire or love. You won't be likely to forget the password if it is funny or endearing. Make it unique to you. Be sure to make it a phrase of two or more words, and continue to slip in your symbols. For example: \"J0hn$Gr@du@tion\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use phonetics in the words**\n",
    "In general, password dictionaries used by attackers search for words embedded inside your password. As mentioned before, don't hesitate to use the words, but make sure you liberally sprinkle those words with embedded symbols. Another way to trump the attacker is to avoid spelling the words properly, or use funny phonetics that you can remember. For instance, \"Run for the hills\" could become \"R0n4dHiLLs!\" or \"R0n 4 d Hills!\" If your manager's name happens to be Ron, you might even get a chuckle each morning typing this in. If you are a lousy speller, you are ahead of the game already.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Don't be afraid to make the password long**\n",
    "If you remember it better as a full phrase, go ahead and type it in. Longer passwords are much harder to break. And even though it is long, if it is easy for you to remember, you will probably have a lot less trouble getting into your system, even if you aren't the best typist in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use first letters of a phrase**\n",
    "To create an easy-to-remember and strong password, begin with a properly capitalized and punctuated sentence that is easy for you to remember. For example: \"My daughter Kay goes to the International School.\" Next, take the first letter of each word in your sentence, preserving the capitalization used in the sentence. In the example above \"MdKgttIS\" would be the result. Finally substitute some non-alphanumeric characters for some of the letters in the password. You might use an \"@\" to replace an \"a\" or use an \"!\" to replace an \"L\". After one such substitution the example password above would be \"MdKgtt!S\"-a very difficult password to break, yet a password that is easy for you to remember, as long as you can recall the sentence on which the password is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do's:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine letters, symbols, and numbers that are easy for you to remember and hard for someone else to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create pronounceable passwords (even if they are not words) that are easier to remember, reducing the temptation to write down your password.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try out using the initial letters of a phrase you love, especially if a number or special character is included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take two familiar things, and then wrap them around a number or special character. Alternatively, change the spelling to include a special character. In this manner, you get one unfamiliar thing (which makes a good password because it is easy for you and you alone to remember, but hard for anyone else to discover). Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"Phone + 4 + you\" = \"Phone4you\" or \"Fone4y0u\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"cat + * + Mouse\" = \"cat*Mouse\" or \"cat*Mou$e\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"attack + 3 + book\" = \"attack3booK\" or \"@tack3booK\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Don'ts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use personal information such as derivatives of your user ID, names of family members, maiden names, cars, license tags, telephone numbers, pets, birthdays, social security numbers, addresses, or hobbies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't use any word in any language spelled forward or backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't tie passwords to the month, for example, don't use \"Mayday\" in May.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don't create new passwords that are substantially similar to ones you've previously used."

The App Store offers developers unlimited bandwidth for hosting, handles payment processing, verifies users, etc. Developers must first register through the Apple Developer Program if they wish to distribute apps through the App Store. The Apple Developer Program offers resources, tools, and support for app development, including testing tools, beta software, analytics, etc. Apple has a long and detailed list of guidelines for all apps that developers and organizations must follow. The guidelines include rules for safety, third-party software development kits (SDKs), ad networks, trademarks and copyrights, and much more. Additionally, submitted apps cannot be copies of other developers’ products, nor can they be designed to steal users’ data.

    "In this reading, you will learn about **dynamic link library (DLL)** files. This information includes how Windows package dependencies can break and how Microsoft has remedied these DLL dependency problems using the `.NET` framework and other methods. You will also learn about the side-by-side assemblies and manifest files for Windows applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic link library (DLL)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Windows DLL files are vital to the core functions of the Windows operating system (OS). Some Windows-compatible applications also use DLL files to function. DLLs are made up of programming modules that contain reusable code. Multiple applications can use and reuse the same DLL files. For example, the `Comdlg32` DLL file is used by many applications to provide Windows dialog box functions. The reusable feature helps Windows conserve disk space and use RAM more efficiently, which improves the operating speed of the OS and applications. The modular structure also makes updating a DLL file fast and simple, eliminating the need to update the entire library. DLL updates are installed once for use by any number of applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "A few common DLLs used by Windows include:\n",
    "- `.drv` files - Device drivers manage the operation of physical devices such as printers.\n",
    "- `.ocx` files - Active X controls provide controls like the program object for selecting a date from a calendar.\n",
    "- `.cpl` files - Control panel files manage each of the functions found in the Windows Control Panel. \n",
    "\n",
    "An application can use DLLs to load parts of the app as modules. This means that if the application offers multiple functions, the app can selectively load only the modules that offer the functionality requested by the user. For example, if a user does not access the Print function within an application, then the printer driver DLL file does not need to be loaded into memory. This system requires less RAM to hold the application in working memory, which improves operating speeds.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**DLL dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Windows package dependency is created when an application uses a DLL file. Although the Windows DLL system supports the sharing of DLL files by multiple applications, the applications’ dependencies can be broken under certain circumstances.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DLL dependencies can be broken when: \n",
    "- **Overwriting DLL dependencies** - It is possible for an application to overwrite the DLL dependency of another app, causing the other app to fail. \n",
    "- **Deleting DLL files** - Some applications and malware may delete the DLLs needed by other applications installed on a system. \n",
    "- **Applying upgrades or fixes to DLLs** - Can cause a problem called “DLL hell” where an application installs a new version of the shared DLL for a computer system. However, other applications that are dependent on the shared DLL have not yet been updated to be compatible with the new version of the DLL. This causes the other applications to fail when the end user tries to launch them.  \n",
    "- **Rolling-back to previous DLL versions** - A user may try to reinstall an older application that stopped working after a shared DLL file was upgraded by a newer app. However, the reinstallation of the app that uses the old DLL version can overwrite the new DLL file. This DLL version roll-back can cause the newer app with the shared DLL dependency to fail the next time it tries to run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft has remedied these problems through the use of:\n",
    "- **Windows File Protection** - The Windows OS controls the updates and deletions of system DLL files. Windows File Protection will allow only applications with valid digital signatures to update and delete DLL files.  \n",
    "- **Private DLLs** - Removes the sharing option from DLLs by creating a private version of the DLL and storing it in the application’s root folder. Changes to the shared version of the DLL will not affect the application’s private copy. \n",
    "- **.NET Framework assembly versioning** - Resolves the “DLL hell” problem by allowing an application to add an updated version of a DLL file without removing the older version of the DLL file. This prevents the malfunction of applications that have dependencies on the older DLL file. The DLL versions can be found in the \"`C:\\Windows\\assembly`\" path and are placed in the **Global Assembly Cache (GAC)**. The GAC contains the .NET “Strong Name Assembly” of each DLL file version. This “Strong Name Assembly” includes the: \n",
    "    - **name of the assembly** - multiple DLL files can share the assembly name \n",
    "    - **version number** - differentiates the version of DLLs \n",
    "    - **culture** - country or region where the application is deployed, can be “neutral”\n",
    "    - **public key token** - a unique 16-character key assigned to an assembly when it is built\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side-by-side assemblies**\n",
    "\n",
    "DLLs and dependencies can also be located in side-by-side assemblies. A **side-by-side assembly** is a public or private resource collection that is available to applications during run time. Side-by-side assemblies contain XML files called **manifests**. The manifests contain data similar to the configuration settings and other data that applications traditionally stored in the Windows registry. Instead of registering this data in the Windows registry, the applications store shared side-by-side assembly manifests in the **WinSxS** folder of the computer. Private manifests are stored inside the application’s folder or they can be embedded in an application or assembly. The metadata of a manifest may include: \n",
    "- **Names** - Manages file naming.\n",
    "- **Resource collections** - Can include one or more DLLs, COM servers, Windows classes, interfaces, and/or type libraries.\n",
    "- **Classes** - Included if versioning is used.\n",
    "- **Dependencies** - Applications and assemblies can create dependencies to other side-by-side assemblies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an IT Support professional, this concept should be considered when troubleshooting application issues. If the application’s configuration settings are not found in the Windows registry, they might be located in the manifest from the app’s side-by-side assembly."

Imagine that you have installed a new hard drive and the Linux server does not seem to recognize the drive.

So, you will need to add an entry in the </span></span><span><strong><span>fstab</span></strong></span><span><span> table so that Linux will know how to mount it and display its entry within the file system. The following steps will guide you through this process:</span></span></p><ol><li><p><span><span>Format the drive using the </span></span><span><strong><span>fdisk</span></strong></span><span><span> command.

You will also learn how to set the appropriate Windows paging file size. As an IT Support specialist, you may want to add or maintain page files to improve system performance. A paging file is an optional tool that uses hard drive space to supplement a system’s RAM capacity. The paging file offloads data from RAM that has not been used recently by the system. Paging files can also be used for system crash dumps or to extend the system commit charge when the computer is in peak usage. However, paging files may not be necessary in systems with a large amount of RAM.</span></span></p><h3 data-heading-variant=\"h3semibold\"><span><span>Page file sizing&nbsp;</span></span></h3><p><span><span>Determining the size needed for a paging file depends on each system’s unique needs and uses. Variables that have an impact on page file sizes include:</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>System crash dump requirements - A system crash dump is generated when a system crashes. A page file can be allocated to accept the Memory.dmp. Crash dumps have several size options that can be useful for various troubleshooting purposes. The page file needs to be large enough to accept the size of the selected crash dump. If the page file is not large enough, the system will not be able to generate the crash dump file. If the system is configured to manage page dumps, the system will automatically size the page files based on the crash dump settings. There are multiple crash dump options. Two common options include:</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><strong><span>Small memory dump: </span></strong></span><span><span>This setting will save the minimum amount of info needed to troubleshoot a system crash. The paging file must have at least 2 MB of hard drive space allocated to it on the boot volume of the Windows system. It should also be configured to generate a new page file for each system crash to save a record of system problems. This history is stored in the&nbsp; Small Dump Directory which is located in the %SystemRoot%\\Minidump file path.&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>To configure a small memory dump file, run the following command using the cmd utility:</span></span></p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><span><span>Wmic recoveros set </span></span><span><strong><span>DebugInfoType</span></strong></span><span><span> = 3</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Alternatively, this option can be configured in the registry:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>Set the </span></span><span><strong><span>CrashDumpEnabled</span></strong></span><span><span> DWORD value to 3</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>To set a folder as the Small Dump Directory, use the following command line:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>Wmic recoveros set </span></span><span><strong><span>MiniDumpDirectory </span></strong></span><span><span>= &lt;folderpath&gt;&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Alternatively, the directory option can be set in the registry:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>Set the </span></span><span><strong><span>MinidumpDir Expandable String Value</span></strong></span><span><span> to &lt;folderpath&gt;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><strong><span>Complete memory dump: </span></strong></span><span><span>The option records the contents of system memory when the computer stops unexpectedly. This option isn't available on computers that have 2 or more GB of RAM. If you select this option, you must have a paging file on the boot volume that is sufficient to hold all the physical RAM plus 1 MB. The file is stored as specified in %SystemRoot%\\Memory.dmp by default. The extra megabyte is required for a complete memory dump file because Windows writes a header in addition to dumping the memory contents. The header contains a crash dump signature and specifies the values of some kernel variables. The header information doesn't require a full megabyte of space, but Windows sizes your paging file in increments of megabytes.</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>To configure a complete memory dump file, run the following command using the cmd utility:</span></span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><span><span>wmic recoveros set </span></span><span><strong><span>DebugInfoType</span></strong></span><span><span> = 1</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Alternatively, a complete memory dump file can be configured in the registry:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>Set the </span></span><span><strong><span>CrashDumpEnabled</span></strong></span><span><span> DWORD value to 1</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>To set a memory dump file, use the following command line:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>wmic recoveros set </span></span><span><strong><span>DebugFilePath =</span></strong></span><span><span> &lt;folderpath&gt;&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Alternatively, the memory dump file can be set in the registry:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>Set the </span></span><span><strong><span>DumpFile Expandable String Value</span></strong></span><span><span> to &lt;folderpath&gt;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>To indicate that the system should not overwrite kernel memory dumps or other complete memory dumps, which may be valuable for troubleshooting system problems, use the command:</span></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>wmic recoveros set </span></span><span><strong><span>OverwriteExistingDebugFile</span></strong></span><span><span> = 0</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Alternatively, the overwrite setting can be turned off in the registry:</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Set the </span></span><span><strong><span>Overwrite</span></strong></span><span><span> DWORD value to 0</span></span></p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p><span><span>Peak usage or expected peak usage of the system commit charge - The system commit limit is the total of RAM plus the amount of disk space reserved for paging files. The system commit charge must be equal to or less than the system commit limit. If a page file is not in place, then the system commit limit is less than the system’s RAM amount. The purpose of these measurements is to prevent the system from overpromising available memory. If this system commit limit is exceeded, Windows or the applications in use may stop functioning properly. So, it is a best practice to assess the amount of disk storage allocated to the page files periodically to ensure there is sufficient space for what the system needs during peak usage. It is fine to reserve 128 GB or more for the page files, if there is sufficient space on the hard drive to dedicate a reserve of this size. However, it might be a waste of available storage space if the system only needs a small fraction of the reserved disk space. If disk space is low, then consider adding more RAM, more hard drive storage, or offload non-system files to network or cloud storage.</span></span></p></li></ul><ul><li><p><span><span>Space needed to offload data from RAM - Page files can serve to store modified pages that are not currently in use. This keeps the information easily accessible in case it is needed again by the system, without overburdening RAM storage. The modified pages to be stored on the hard drive are recorded in the </span></span><span><strong><span>\\Memory\\Modified Page List Bytes</span></strong></span><span><span> directory. If the page file is not large enough, some of the pages added to the Modified Page List Bytes might not be written to the page file. If this happens, the page file either needs to be expanded or additional page filles should be added to the system. To assess if the page file is too small, the following conditions must be true:&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>\\Memory\\Available MBytes indicates more physical memory is needed.</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>A significant amount of memory exists in the modified page list.</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>\\Paging Files(*)% Usage (existing page files) are almost full.&nbsp;</span></span></p></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div>"

    "The NTFS file system contains a file called the **master file table**, or **MFT**. There is at least one entry in the MFT for every file on an NTFS file system volume, including the MFT itself. All information about a file, including its size, time and date stamps, permissions, and data content, is stored either in MFT entries, or in space outside the MFT that is described by MFT entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As files are added to an NTFS file system volume, more entries are added to the MFT and the MFT increases in size. When files are deleted from an NTFS file system volume, their MFT entries are marked as free and may be reused. However, disk space that has been allocated for these entries is not reallocated, and the size of the MFT does not decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NTFS file system reserves space for the MFT to keep the MFT as contiguous as possible as it grows. The space reserved by the NTFS file system for the MFT in each volume is called the **MFT zone**. Space for file and directories are also allocated from this space, but only after all of the volume space outside of the MFT zone has been allocated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the average file size and other variables, either the reserved MFT zone or the unreserved space on the disk may be allocated first as the disk fills to capacity. Volumes with a small number of relatively large files will allocate the unreserved space first, while volumes with a large number of relatively small files allocate the MFT zone first. In either case, fragmentation of the MFT starts to take place when one region or the other becomes fully allocated. If the unreserved space is completely allocated, space for user files and directories will be allocated from the MFT zone. If the MFT zone is completely allocated, space for new MFT entries will be allocated from the unreserved space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MFT itself can be defragmented. To reduce the chance of the MFT zone becoming fully allocated before the defragmentation process is complete, leave as much space at the beginning of the MFT zone as possible before defragmenting the volume. If the MFT zone becomes fully allocated before defragmentation has completed, there must be unallocated space outside of the MFT zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default MFT zone is calculated and reserved by the system when it mounts the volume, and is based on volume size. You can increase the MFT zone by means of the registry entry detailed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 174619](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/174619), but you cannot make the default MFT zone smaller than what is calculated. Increasing the MFT zone does not decrease the disk space that users can use for data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the current size of the MFT, analyze the NTFS file system drive with Disk Defragmenter, then click the View Report button. The drive statistics will be displayed, including the current MFT size, and number of fragments. You can also obtain the size of the MFT by using the [FSCTL_GET_NTFS_VOLUME_DATA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-fsctl_get_ntfs_volume_data) control code."

    "Symbolic links can either be absolute or relative links. **Absolute links** are links that specify each portion of the path name; **relative links** are determined relative to where relative–link specifiers are in a specified path. Relative links are specified using the following conventions:\n",

    "The NTFS file system supports three types of file links: \n",
    "- hard links, \n",
    "- junctions, and \n",
    "- symbolic links. \n",
    "\n",
    "This article is an overview of hard links and junctions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard links**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **hard link** is the file-system representation of a file by which more than one path references a single file in the _same_ volume. To create a hard link, use the [CreateHardLinkA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/WinBase/nf-winbase-createhardlinka) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any changes made to a hard-linked file are instantly visible to applications that access it through the links that reference it. The attributes on the file are reflected in every hard link to that file, and changes to that file's attributes propagate to all the hard links. However, the directory entry size and attribute information of the file are visibly updated only at the link through which the change was made. For example, if you clear the read-only attribute flag on a particular hard link so you can delete that hard link, and there are multiple hard links to the file, the other hard links display that the read-only attribute is still set, which isn't true. To change the file back to the read-only state, you must set the read-only flag on the file from one of its remaining hard links.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a system where `C:` and `D:` are local drives and `Z:` is a network drive mapped to `\\\\fred\\share`, the following references are permitted as a hard link:\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\dira\\ethel.txt linked to C:\\dirb\\dirc\\lucy.txt\n",
    "D:\\dir1\\tinker.txt linked to D:\\dir2\\dirx\\bell.txt\n",
    "C:\\diry\\bob.bak linked to C:\\dir2\\mina.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following references aren't permitted:\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\dira linked to C:\\dirb\n",
    "C:\\dira\\ethel.txt linked to D:\\dirb\\lucy.txt\n",
    "C:\\dira\\ethel.txt linked to Z:\\dirb\\lucy.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a hard link, use the [DeleteFileA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/FileAPI/nf-fileapi-deletefilea) function. You can delete hard links in any order regardless of the order in which they're created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Junctions**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **junction** (also called a **soft link**) differs from a hard link in that the storage objects it references are _separate directories_. A junction can also link directories located on different local volumes on the same computer. Otherwise, junctions operate identically to hard links. Junctions are implemented through [reparse points](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/reparse-points).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the same conditions in the Hard Links section, the following references are permitted as junctions:\n",

    "C:\\dirx linked to D:\\diry\n",

As an IT Support specialist, you will most likely encounter instances of data corruption in onsite systems. It is critical for you to know how to recover corrupted data, file systems, and hard drives.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>A computer file system is software that provides structure for storing the operating system (OS) and all other software installed on system hard drives. A hard drive must be formatted with a file system before the operating system can be installed. Since Linux is an open source OS, innovators have created nearly 100 file systems that support Linux OS installations. Several common file systems that are used for Linux systems include ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, JFS, XFS, ZFS, F2FS, and more.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Like all software, software-based computer file systems can experience corruption. File system corruption can impede the computer’s ability to locate files stored on the hard drive, including important OS files. File locations are stored as i-nodes (index nodes) in Linux. Every file in a Linux system has its own i-node identifier. The i-node stores metadata about the storage block and fragment location(s) where each file is stored. The i-node metadata also holds information about the file type, size of the files, file permissions, links to the file, and more.</span></span></p><h3 data-heading-variant=\"h3semibold\"><span><span>Symptoms of data corruption</span></span></h3><p><span><span>Symptoms of data corruption can include:&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>System suddenly shuts down</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>Software program will not launch or it crashes when opening a corrupted file. May also give an error message saying:&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>“File format not recognized” </span></span><span><em><span>or&nbsp;</span></em></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>“(file name) is not recognized”&nbsp;</span></span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span><span>Corrupted files and folders may no longer appear in the file system.&nbsp;</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>The operating system (OS) may report bad sectors when failing to execute commands.</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>Damaged platter-based hard drives can make clicking sounds or unusual vibrations.\n",
    "</span></span></p></li></ul><h3 data-heading-variant=\"h3semibold\"><span><span>Causes of data corruption</span></span></h3><p><span><span>Data corruption on system hard drives and file systems can be caused by:&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><strong><span>Software errors</span></strong></span><span><span> -&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Software errors can be any software event that interferes with normal hard disk read/write operations.</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>Viruses and malware can be designed to intentionally cause corruption to data.&nbsp;</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>Antivirus software can damage files if the software experiences problems while scanning or repairing the files.</span></span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span><strong><span>Hardware malfunctions</span></strong></span><span><span> -&nbsp;</span></span></p><ul><li><p><span><span>Larger files are more likely to experience corruption than smaller files. Large files occupy more disk space, making them statistically more likely to cross a bad sector on the hard drive.&nbsp;</span></span></p></li><li><p><span><span>Hard drives that contain platters are at risk of experiencing malfunctioning read/write heads. Damaged heads can corrupt multiple files and directories in a single read/write transaction. Hard drives with moving mechanical parts are more likely to experience failures from moving parts that wear out over time.&nbsp;</span></span></p></li></ul></li><li><p><span><strong><span>Electrical damage</span></strong></span><span><span> - Can happen when a power failure occurs while the system is writing data to a hard drive.</span></span></p></li></ul><h3 data-heading-variant=\"h3semibold\"><span><span>Data corruption repair</span></span></h3><p><span><span>The most critical first step, after data corruption has been identified or suspected, is to shut down the affected hard drive(s). The reason for this step is to stop the cause of the corruption from writing to the hard drives. The longer the corruption activity continues, the more difficult recovering the data becomes.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Precautions should be taken before powering up a corrupted hard drive to run repair tools. It is important to minimize any read/write operations on the disk other than those produced by data recovery tools. One method to prevent further damage could be to have a corrupted Linux system boot from an external device or network (PXE boot). An alternative method might be to attach the corrupted hard drive as an external hard drive to a healthy system running Linux. A hard drive adapter or drive docking station can be used to convert an internal drive into an external device.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span><span>Before connecting a corrupted drive to a healthy system, the </span></span><span><strong><span>automount</span></strong></span><span><span> service must be disabled. The</span></span><span><strong><span> fsck</span></strong></span><span><span> command will not repair corruption on a mounted file system. In fact, mounting a corrupted file system can cause the healthy Linux system to crash. Although the corrupted file system should not be mounted, the device file for the corrupted hard drive in the </span></span><span><strong><span>/dev directory </span></strong></span><span><span>must be readable for the </span></span><span><strong><span>fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>command to access the drive.&nbsp;</span></span></p><h3 data-heading-variant=\"h3semibold\"><span><span>The </span></span><span><strong><span>fsck</span></strong></span><span><span> command</span></span></h3><p><span><em><strong><span>Important Warning:</span></strong></em></span><span><em><span> The</span></em></span><span><em><strong><span> fsck</span></strong></em></span><span><em><span> command should NOT be used:</span></em></span></p><ul><li><p><span><em><span>on a hard drive that was a member of a RAID array.</span></em></span></p></li><li><p><span><em><span>on a mounted file system (must be unmounted).&nbsp;</span></em></span></p></li></ul><p><span><span>An important command line data recovery tool offered in the Linux operating system is the</span></span><span><strong><span> fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>command. It should be run anytime a Linux system malfunctions. The </span></span><span><strong><span>fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>command can check the file system and repair some, but not all, inconsistencies found. In some cases, </span></span><span><strong><span>fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>may recommend deleting a corrupted file or directory. The default setting for the </span></span><span><strong><span>fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>command is to prompt the user to approve or deny the repair of any problems found. The user running the</span></span><span><strong><span> fsck </span></strong></span><span><span>command must have write permissions for the corrupted file or directory to be able to approve a repair.

      "       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can\n",
      "       appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally\n",
      "       identical, due to the many standards and ps implementations that this\n",
      "       ps is compatible with.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Note that ps -aux is distinct from ps aux.  The POSIX and UNIX\n",
      "       standards require that ps -aux print all processes owned by a user\n",

    "Balancing resources keeps a computer system running smoothly. When processes are using too many resources, operating problems may occur. To avoid problems from the overuse of resources, you should monitor the usage of resources. Monitoring resources and adjusting the balance is important to keep computers running at their best.

    "\n",
    "A load for a system that is idle with no processes running or waiting to run is classified as a `0`. Every process running or waiting to run adds a value of `1` to the load. This means if you have `3` applications running and `2` on the waitlist, the load is `5`. The higher the load, the more resources are being used, and the more the load should be monitored to keep the system running smoothly. \n",

    "The load as a measurement doesn’t provide much information as it constantly changes as processes run. To account for this, an average is used to measure the load on the system. The **load average** is calculated by finding the load over a given period of time. Linux uses three decimal values to show the load over time instead of the percent other systems use. An easy way to check the load average is to run the `uptime` command in the terminal. The following image depicts the load values returned from the `uptime` command. \n",

    "\n",

    "- **Average CPU load for last 15 minutes** corresponds to 0.038, meaning on average, 4% of the CPU has been used over the last 15 minutes. \n",

    "Another way you can monitor the load average in Linux is to use the **`top` (table of processes)** command in the terminal. The result of running the `top` command is an in-depth view of the resources being used on your system. \n",

    "1. **Sleeping** shows the number of processes awaiting resources in their normal state. \n",

The process created by the kernel in Linux is known as the **Parent Process**. All the processes derived from the parent process are termed as **Child Processes**.\n",

    "- The load in Linux is calculated by adding `1` for each process that is running or waiting to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitoring the average load of Linux allows an IT professional to identify which processes are running to determine what to end in order to balance the system. A balanced system runs with fewer problems than one that is using too high of a percent of resources. \n",

    "Virtualization creates a simulated computer environment for running a complete operating system (OS). The simulated computer environment is called a virtual machine (VM). On a VM, you can run an OS as if it were running directly on your physical hardware. This reading explains how virtual machines work and introduces some tools for creating a VM.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How VMs work**\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machine software creates a virtualized environment that behaves like a separate computer system. The VM runs in a window on the operating system of your physical computer. The operating system that runs on your physical computer is called the “host” OS. Any operating systems running inside a VM are called “guests.” In the virtual environment, you can install your guest OS, and it will function like it’s running on a physical machine. Whenever you want to use the guest OS, open your VM software and run the guest OS in a window on your host desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a virtual machine lets you experiment with different operating systems without having to uninstall or replace your host OS. For example, you can try a Linux OS as a VM on your Windows computer to see how the two OSs compare, or you can use a VM on your Linux system to run a Mac software package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of VMs is that they are isolated from the rest of your system. Software running inside a VM doesn’t affect the host OS or other VMs on your system. This isolation makes VMs a safe place to test software even when there is a risk of negative effects on a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of VMs is significant reduction in hardware and electricity costs. You can run many VMs on a single host by dividing available hardware resources among each virtualized environment. Modern computer hardware offers a lot of computing power in a single device. But a typical OS will require only a fraction of the computing resources available in a computer. This means you won’t have to run those systems on several physical computers that are only partially used.\n",
    "\n",
    "VM software divides hardware resources among virtualized environments by designating a portion of resources as virtual resources. When you create a VM you may be asked to specify the amount of physical hard drive space you want to set apart for your VM to use. The VM software will create a virtual hard drive for your VM of the specified size. VM software may have you also specify the amount of RAM you want to allocate for your VM. After you create the VM, you can usually adjust resource allocations. If you want more drive space or RAM for your VM, you can adjust the settings in the VM software to allocate more of those resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VM software**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common Virtual Machine software used to create VMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VirtualBox** runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris hosts. VirtualBox supports various guest operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Solaris, OpenBSD, and macOS. VirtualBox is open-source software available for free on the VirtualBox [download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hyper-V** is a Microsoft's virtualization platform. It is available as an integrated feature on the Windows operating system. Hyper-V supports Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD virtual machines. It does not support macOS. See [Microsoft’s Hyper-V for Windows documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) for information on how to access Hyper-V on recent versions of Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VMware** desktop software runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS hosts. VMware Workstation Player is the VMware software that lets users run multiple operating systems on a single physical personal computer. It is freely available for non-commercial use on the [VMware Workstation Download page](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Red Hat Virtualization (RHV)** is a business-oriented platform developed for virtualization in enterprise computing contexts. RHV supports a variety of guest systems. Red Hat charges an annual subscription fee for product access, updates, patches, and technical support. See [Red Hat’s RHV Datasheet](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/red-hat-virtualization-datasheet) for information on how to implement RHV on existing hardware infrastructures.\n",

    "In this reading, you will learn about operating system (OS) deployment methods, including the use of disk cloning. A cloned disk is an identical copy of a hard drive. Cloning is often used when an Enterprise company purchases a large number of identical computers. The IT Support Administrators for the company are responsible for installing and configuring the computers to meet the needs of the company and its network. Disk cloning is used to save time on this type of deployment. IT Administrators will select one of the new computers to install and configure needed items, such as the OS, utilities, tools, network settings, software, drivers, firmware, and more. Then they make a clone of this first hard drive. The cloned disk is used to copy the entire disk image over to the remaining new computers so that the IT Admins do not need to repeat the same installation and configuration steps on each new computer. They may keep a copy of the original disk from this deployment to reimage the systems if a clean OS install is required (e.g., following a virus or malware infection, OS corruption, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cloned disks have uses beyond deploying OSs. They can be used to test new software and configurations in a lab environment before applying the updates to similar production systems. Cloning can also be used for system migrations, data backups, disk archival, or to make a copy of a hard drive for investigative or auditing purposes.  "

    "**Hard drive duplicators** are machines that can make identical copies of hard drives. The original drive is inserted into the duplicator machine along with one or more blank hard drives as targets. Disk duplicators can have anywhere from a single target bay for limited disk cloning (example use: law enforcement investigations) up to 100+ target bays for industrial use (example use: computer manufacturing). If the target drives are not blank, the duplicator machine can wipe the drives. The target drives usually need to share the same characteristics (e.g., interface, form factor, transfer rate) of the original drive. The targets should also have the same or greater storage capacity than the original. \n",

    "The hard drive duplicator may have an LCD interface built-in to the machine and/or a management software/HTML interface, the latter of which can be accessed over a networked or directly-connected computer or server. The duplicator interface can be used to initiate and manage disk cloning and/or disk wiping (reformatting). Most duplicators copy data  sector-by-sector. The time to transfer data from the original to the target drives depends on multiple variables. The machine’s user manual should be consulted to calculate duplication time."

For example, a hard drive can be cloned from an IDE drive to an SSD drive, a CD-ROM/DVD, removable USB drive, cloud-based systems, or other storage media, and vice versa. Software cloning supports full disk copies (including the OS, all settings, software, and data) or copies of selected partitions of the drive (useful for data-only or OS-only copies). Disk cloning software is often used by IT Administrators who need to deploy disk images across a network to target workstations or to cloud-based systems.

    "As an IT Support professional, you will likely run into problems caused by a full primary hard drive, where the OS is installed. An affected computer may display an error message stating there is insufficient space on the drive to save new files, apply an update, or install new software. In some cases, the computer might not provide an informative error message at all. Instead, the system may experience performance issues, hang, crash, or it might not even load the OS after booting. Note that it is a best practice to routinely perform maintenance and clean-up of computer hard drives to free storage space, improve system performance, and prevent the myriad of issues that can arise when the primary hard drive is full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that you are an IT Support Specialist for an organization. An employee reports that their computer is running very slowly and keeps hanging. You know that Windows Update had been scheduled to run overnight to update all of the organization’s systems with multiple patches, updates, and fixes. Although it is possible for these changes to cause system problems, there is only one employee reporting a problem. So, it is more likely that the system did not have adequate storage space to install all of the updates on that employee’s computer system. You suspect that the primary hard drive could be full. Your troubleshooting and repair steps might include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check how much free storage space remains**. A quick and easy troubleshooting step for system performance issues is to check if the primary hard drive is full. In this scenario, you discover that the employee’s hard drive has less than 5 GB of space left. Microsoft recommends giving Windows 10 at least 20 GB of free space for normal OS processes. You will need to find at least 15 GB of files to delete or move to another storage location. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Delete temporary and unneeded files**. There are a few methods for cleaning out junk files from Windows. Two system maintenance tools for this purpose, found in several versions of Windows, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Storage Sense**: Use the Windows Storage Sense tool to delete unnecessary files like temporary files, offline cloud files, downloads, and those stored in the Recycle Bin. You can also configure Storage Sense to regularly and automatically clean the hard drive for proactive maintenance. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Disk Cleanup**: A simple alternative tool to Storage Sense. Disk Cleanup performs most of the same operations as Storage Sense, plus it offers a drive compression utility. Note: If you run Disk Cleanup on a drive, but the computer is still reporting “Low Disk Space”, the Temp folder is most likely filling up with Microsoft Store .appx files. In this case, you will need to clear the cache for Microsoft Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reset Windows Update**. Since you know the employee’s computer went through a Windows Update overnight and possibly did not complete this process fully, it may be wise to perform a Windows Update reset. The reset tool can check whether a system reboot is required to apply the updates, security settings were changed, update files are missing or corrupted, service registrations are missing or corrupt, and more.This utility can be found in the Windows system Settings menu, under Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters >  Windows Update.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Move files off of the primary hard drive and onto** (one or more of the following): \n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Internal or external storage device**: Install an additional hard drive or add an external storage device, like a USB drive or SD card, to hold user files.\n",

In these environments, end users should have network drive space mapped to their workstations for file storage, instead of saving files to their local hard drives. \n",
    "\n",
